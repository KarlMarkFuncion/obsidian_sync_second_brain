**Cardio (2 days per week):**

- **Start with brisk walking with weights (10kg)** for 30 minutes, gradually increasing distance and duration.
- **Incorporate interval training:** Alternate between high-intensity bursts (jogging, running) and low-intensity recovery periods (walking).
- **Focus on building endurance and stamina.**

**Phase 2: Strength & Cardio Integration (Weeks 9-16)**

This phase combines heavier strength training with more specific cardio drills.

**Strength Training (3 days per week):**

- **Split routine:** Divide workouts into upper body, lower body, and core days.
- **4 sets of 6-8 repetitions:** Use heavier weights while maintaining good form.

- **Hill repeats:** Walk or jog uphill with weights, focusing on leg strength and endurance.
- **Weighted lunges:** Add weight to traditional lunges for a full-body challenge.
- **Box jumps:** Use a sturdy box or platform for jumps, building power and explosiveness.
- **Sprints:** Incorporate short bursts of high-intensity running, gradually increasing distance and speed.

**Phase 3: Goal Specific Refinement (Weeks 17-24)**

This phase fine-tunes your training to directly address your benchmarks.

**Strength Training (4 days per week):**

- **Add accessory exercises:** Include isolation exercises specific to your weak points.
- **Implement powerlifting techniques:** Learn and practice proper form for bench press, deadlift, and squat for optimal performance.
- **Peak weeks:** Introduce heavier weights and lower reps (3-5) closer to your target benchmarks.
- **Rest 3-5 minutes between sets.**

**Cardio (2 days per week):**

- **Distance running:** Train for your 10km goal with weights, gradually increasing pace and distance.
- **Specificity drills:** Practice carrying weighted objects like sandbags or backpacks to simulate car lifting scenario.
- **Rest 2-3 minutes between sets.**

**Note:** This is just a sample program and may need adjustments. Consider factors like your current fitness level, access to equipment, and individual needs. Remember, consistency is key! Be patient, track your progress, and adjust your program as needed to reach your goals.

**Additional Tips:**

- Prioritize proper form over lifting heavier weights.
- Warm up before each workout and cool down afterward.
