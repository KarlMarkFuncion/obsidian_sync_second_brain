Discernment
- The difference between what's good and bad is what you use it for.
	- In the same way light can show you where to go. it can blind you and burn your eyes
	- In the same way darkness can help you sleep. It can hide the monsters in itself
	- In the same way food is delicious and can sustain you. It can be abused and turn you into a sedentary heap of fat and filth.
