I'm currently sick right now so that puts a damper on what kinda work I can do. But I'll try my best here.

Notable recent events:
1. I don't wanna date Reyziel rn, and it seems she's not keen right now either. But it could also be that she's busy. It's likely the latter. But personally for me to her. I don't feel like talking to her rn.
2. Papa recommended I learn some basic CyberSec skills for my future career. Although that career isn't an entry level thing. I find it a good play to make in the future while I enjoy my time with programming.
	- 
		1. Firewall, Proxy, DMZ
		2. Cloud

4. I'm deciding to leverage my ADHD to make technology dabbling projects. Here is an idea I have right now:
	1. Make a home cloud server using my old DELL laptop as my home storage server for my files.
5. 

To Do List

[] I want to do music tomorrow
[] Do the thingy with Alerted page
[] Get the thing to work -- arduino and prototype
[] Research how to make a home server with an older computer
[] Avoid talking to Reizi right now. I'm gonna get too clingy with her if I talk rn. If she forgets and loses interest with me? So be it. Let the Lord handle my love life and her choices to live life with me.
[] Wash all the bedstuffs under the sofa bed.
[] Wash Khalil's bed and start sleeping there starting tomorrow.
[] I want to go to the Gym right now. even if it's just light weights : (
