I can't let my life depend on chance as I learned from God by example of the Lotta draw. I have to place my influence alongside God and trust in him as Joseph teh dreamer did with all the situations he found himself in.

However this places me in the situation of... How? How do I exercise this lesson and current fact of life? Well. I suppose I could continue doing my website, going to the gym, and dabbling with new hobbies no matter how non-committal I am to them so I can satiate my desire for productive novelty and work.

Okay? but that also raises the question of... how do I know how much time and money to spend on them? Well, a day should be fine right? hmmm... I think this is something a few articles from more learned people might help with.

But before I do that. I think I can recall previous knowledge to answer this. I've learned from Michael Choi that I could learn a new Language or technology in a day. With knowledge on the basics on how it works and place it in my resume. That implies a project, knowledge of the inner workings, and being able to manipulate the knowledge of it for novel ways, and ability to know and figure out new possibilities for it.

With this knowledge in mind. I think a day completely dedicated for it would be good. a quarter day without much distractions even. Soooooo 6 hours. I think I can do that? Music may be a good example. I'll lay out a potential plan right now.

MAAAAAN I CAN'T BE BOTHERED WITH THIS BS BRO T_T. Ayoko nang mag-aral. Pero tbh bawal kasi I know kasama ko si Lord at Hesu Kristo so bawal kasi ayun utos nila. Utos nilang igalang ang aking mga magulang at ang pag-aaral sakin ang kanilang hiling. Kaya bawal talaga.

HRNGGGGRGRHGRHGRHG. Bawal magreklamo... pero nahihirapan ako kasi parang walang punto rin kasi yung subject eh.... pero wait.... hmmmm.... paano kaya kung nag-solo study nalang ako ng BOHS habang nagrereport sila? maybe this will work > : )

I love the lord pero parang nahihirapan na ko kung anong sunod na galaw ko kay Reizi ah. " KM, hayaan mo lang siya and hayaan mo ang sarili mo sa sarili mo."

"Bear with it. For God is with you."

Potential study plan for music from 10AM - 4PM
1. 1.5 Hours downloading free music software (FL Studio, Vocaloid Software, etc)
2. 50 minutes setting up the programs with tutorials to know what to do
3. 1.5 hours making the melody in FL studio (30 seconds may be good)
4. 1.5 hours making the melody lyrics in Vocaloid studio
5. 40 minutes allocated wherever as extra time.

( note that the above schedule is extremely optimistic??? Or not, I think it's possible if I allow myself to do so and focus on on the process. I can just eat lunch while my programs are installing : 3 )
