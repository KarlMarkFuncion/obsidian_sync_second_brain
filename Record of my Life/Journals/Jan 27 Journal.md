I wanna try subsisting off of the affection of friends.

If I truly believe and think that romance is a sidegrade to true friendship. Then the vocation of being single should be pretty good and as good as the vocation of dating.

It's obvious to me I need to do some maturing in the dating realm before I can even think about doing a healthy relationship. And in lateral to that, I'm not even doing healthy friendships and famailial relationshi
